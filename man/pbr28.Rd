\title{PBR28 Test-Retest Data}
\format{A nested data frame with 24 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
  \item{PET}{Descriptor of the PET measurement}
  \item{Subjname}{Descriptor of which individual was measured}
  \item{PETNo}{Descriptor of the PET number}
  \item{tacs}{Nested tibble of the TAC data. Consists of Times, in seconds; Weights, between 0 and 1; StartTime, in seconds; Duration, in seconds, and TACs for Frontal Cortex (FC), Temporal Cortex (TC), Striatum (STR), Thalamus (THA), Whole Brain (WB), and Cerebellum (CBL)}
  \item{blooddata}{Nested tibble of the blood data. Note that this data is following preprocessing, and does not contain information about automatic and manual sampling. Consists of Time in seconds (Time), blood radioactivity following dispersion correction (Cbl_dispcorr) and plasma radioactivity following metabolite correction (Cpl_metabcorr)}
  \item{input}{Nested tibble of the input data, obtained from the blooddata with the blood_interp command}
  \item{Genotype}{Refers to the High Affinity Binder (HAB) or Medium Affinity Binder (MAB) genotype}
  \item{injRad}{Injected radioactivity}
